# Graph Closure
a simple python script to calculate the Closure of a graph!

**Explanation** : In Graph-Theory, The closure of a graph G with n vertices, denoted by c(G), is the graph obtained from G by repeatedly adding edges between non-adjacent vertices whose degrees sum to at least n, until this can no longer be done.
